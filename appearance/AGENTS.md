# Appearance Changes

Follow these rules for layout, color, and other visual edits.

- Prefer CSS classes over inline styles; group related rules together and reuse utility classes.
- Preserve the existing color palette unless there is a clear accessibility or contrast improvement—note the reason if you change colors.
- Keep typography consistent; align font sizes with the nearest existing scale and avoid unnecessary font families.
- Check spacing on both desktop and narrow viewports when adjusting layout.
- Document new visual patterns with a short comment near the relevant stylesheet block if the intention is not obvious.
